## How many time it took me to do it ?

I made the search bar in 6 days but i got a lot of difficulties dues at the fact i don't know ReactJs.  
The last day i made the header and i didn't get big issues with it.

### My issue :

#### What was my first issue ?

The first issue i got and i "solved" was about the date, i couldn't do like the models because i don't knew the ReactJs, so i had to find a way to still do it without using React and i find it with the date of Jquery.

#### What was my other issues ?

I got some issues with the way selector and the selector of the number of person who isn't in include in html so i recreate it with js.

I also got some issues with the API to understand it, but I understood it and got no big issue after that.
